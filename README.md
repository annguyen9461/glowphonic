# ðŸŒ¸ Glowphonic

Glowphonic is an interactive digital musical instrument that combines touch, motion, and visual feedback into a sculptural, expressive performance interface. Built inside a cherry blossom lampshade, its glowing petals play musical notes, respond to gestures, and pulse with light based on both user touch and audio amplitude.

## Features

- **12-Key Capacitive Touch Petals**  
  Touch-sensitive petals mapped to notes across two keyboard octaves, triggering sounds in Max/MSP.

- **6-DOF IMU (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)**  
  Tilting forward modulates the tremolo effect of the played sample in real-time.

- **Slide Potentiometer**  
  Adjusts keyboard volume dynamically in Max/MSP.

- **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor**  
  Controls sample loop speedâ€”closer hand proximity causes faster repetition.

- **Lighting Feedback (NeoPixel Strip)**  
  An ESP32 receives serial data from Max and blinks LEDs in response to either touch or amplitude spikes.

## System Architecture

- **Sensor Input:**  
  An Arduino Nano reads sensor values (touch, IMU, slider, distance) and sends data to Max/MSP via serial USB.

- **Data Processing & Sound Generation:**  
  Max/MSP receives and maps sensor input to musical parameters (note triggers, tremolo, volume, etc.).

- **Visual Output:**  
  Max sends trigger messages to an ESP32-S3 via serial. The ESP32 flashes a 60-pixel NeoPixel strip when data is received, syncing lights to gesture or beat.
